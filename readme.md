## TODO
**GRAPHICS**

* make proper graphics for kamikaze and boss1

**GAME LOGIC**

* persistent highscores with loadTable or loadStrings

  * slow enemies down while harvesting their aura instead of after aura was harvested for that sucking-their-energy kinda feel
  * make it possible that aura can shrink when harvested

**DIAGNOSTICS**

* make a line on top of screen that displays current velocities

  * make the diagnostics togglable with a key

**BALANCE**

  * balance the gameplay more (increase beginning difficulty, slow down the difficulty ramp (currently 100+ is way to hard))
  * add different difficulties with diff parameters (three different init functions?)

**ENEMIES**

  * make boss2: many hp, slow but accelerating, follows player like kamikaze
  * enemy type that follows you for a bit after death
  * imagine a better logic for when the bosses appear

**SOUND**

  * find a longer sound to paulstretch a nicer background soundscape
  * improve the steering wobble sound
  * have higher variety of aura 'pop' sounds
